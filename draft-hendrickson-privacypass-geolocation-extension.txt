1.  Introduction

   Some Privacy Pass token types support binding additional information
   to the tokens, often referred to as public metadata.
   [AUTH-EXTENSIONS] describes an extension parameter to the basic
   PrivateToken HTTP authentication scheme [AUTH-SCHEME] for supplying
   this metadata alongside a token.  [EXTENDED-ISSUANCE] describes
   variants of the basic Privacy Pass issuance protocols
   [BASIC-ISSUANCE] that support issuing tokens with public metadata.
   However, there are no existing extensions defined to make use of
   these protocol extensions.

   This document describes an extension for Privacy Pass that allows
   tokens to encode geolocation hints.  These hints can be used by
   origins that redeem tokens to influence its behavior in various ways,
   such as determining the content of HTTP responses.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Geolocation Hint Extension

   The geolocation hint extension is an extension used to convey rough
   geolocation hints to origins that do not already have accurate or
   authoritative mappings for the IP addresses of clients.  This can be
   particularly useful for cases where IP geolocation mappings have
   changed recently, or a client is using a VPN or proxy that may not be
   commonly recognized by servers.

   The value of this extension is an GeoHintTimestamp, defined as
   follows.

   struct {
      opaque geo_hint<1..2^16-1>;
   } GeoHint;

   The GeoHintTimestamp fields are defined as follows:

   *  "geo_hint" is a string formatted as defined in Section 2.1.1 of
      [GEOFEED].  It contains a comma-separated list of Alpha2code,
      Region, and City.  The value SHOULD NOT contain a Postal Code.
      All values MUST be uppercase to prevent adding extra entropy
      through mixed casing.

   As an example, a GeoHint structure corresponding to the
   "192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster" entry would be:

   struct {
      opaque geo_hint<1..2^16-1>; // "US,US-AL,ALABASTER"
   } GeoHint;

4.  Security Considerations

   Geolocation information can contribute to a client's fingerprint.
   Exposing precise geolocation information can therefore lead to
   anonymity set partitioning, as described in [ARCHITECTURE].  More
   general information regarding the use of extensions and their
   possible impact on client privacy can be found in [ARCHITECTURE].

   Servers MUST NOT use IP Geolocation Client Hints for making security
   or access-control decisions, as the value can be spoofed by a client.
   The hint is intended only for use in optimizing behavior.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following entry into the "Privacy Pass
   PrivateToken Extensions" registry.

   *  Expiration extension

      -  Type: 0x0002

      -  Name: Geolocation hint

      -  Value: GeoHint value as defined in Section 3

      -  Reference: This document

      -  Notes: None
